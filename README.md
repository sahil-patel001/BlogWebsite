This is a simple blog website which I made using codeigniter 4 framework and php. There are two sides of this project. Admin side panel and user dashboard. 

User can add, delete and update a blog which is made by him self and also can see the blogs of other user and can report if required. User also can like the blog and see all the liked blogs in different section inside dashboard.

Admin have to approved or reject the blog which is posted by a user. If blog is rejected by an admin so the blog is not going live and no one can see it. But if it gets approved so all user can see it at home page. Admin also can add, delete and update user and also can add another admin from it's dashboard. it also can see all the reported blog and can disable it from showing to all user. with that it also have functionality to see all the messages from user about their queries and can reply them via email.

User can check the status of it's blog at post status. also can send message regarding their blog for modification or status which is pending or rejected.

This is all about this project. If you like it or if it's help you then please give it a start. Thank you.
